Builing an Internal AI Assistant
==============================

# Overview

The project aims to leverage the natural language processing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by providing them with additional information about the specific domains we want to exploit.

In this case, the project is specifically focused on building a Company Internal AI Assistant that possesses the ability to answer questions about the company's policies and business knowledge. The Assistant would be able to help employees easily research internal textual information using natural language. This would result in: 

1. Better familiarization with the vast corpus of information within a large company for new and junior employees
2. Lowering the burden of continuously answering repetitive questions for senior employees, making the process of training their successors more efficient.
3. A valuable tool for every employee when it comes to sensitive situations that need to meticulously consider the guidance of company policies or even government laws.
